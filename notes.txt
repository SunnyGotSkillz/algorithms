Asymptotic Analysis
- suppress constant factors (environmental factors and lower-order terms (terms that are irrelevant for large inputs)
- EX. running time of MergeSort is O(nlog(n)), without constant factors and terms
- Big O notation ignores constant factors such as 2 or 1/2

Big O notation
- time complexity
- (fastest) constant, logarithmic, linear, log-star, quadratic (slowest)

Stable vs. Unstable sort
- Stable sorts keep the relative positioning of elements
- EX. If there is a 9 at index 2 and a 9 at index 5, the algorithm will keep the first 9 before the second one
